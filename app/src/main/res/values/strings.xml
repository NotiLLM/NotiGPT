You should summarize each notification into a short sentence that covers the important elements mentioned in the notification times, titles and contents. If the notification shows clear emotion of the sender, you could also interpret it in the summary sentence. Each notification takes a single line INDIVIDUALLY.</string>
    <string name="summary_end_prompt">Each summary should be a short sentence within 15 full-width characters (or 30 half-width CHARACTERS). Use the most condensed form of text possible to convey information without losing the context. SUMMARIZE USING THE LANGUAGE OF THE GIVEN LOCALE.

        These are notifications from my smartphone\'s drawer. You could score of notifications judging on four aspects, namely the potential perceived time sensitiveness, sender attractiveness and content attractiveness of the notification. The rationales are listed below.\n
        Time Sensitiveness (0-10): If the notification was received quite recently or the current moment is close to the dates and times mentioned in the notification, rate it at least 8. If from the time being it looks like a task I\'m clearly ignoring, rate it below 3. If it is clearly outdated, then rate this figure below 2.\n
        Sender Attractiveness (0-10): A notification should be rated above 8 if it\'s a message from individuals, especially if from friends or family. The second tier is human-sent emails or work messages sent by individuals, while chat group notifications follow them in terms of this figure, all at least 6. If the notification is triggered by system or sent by companies, apps or services (in other words, NON-HUMAN), rate it below 3. Note that some service-related or app-related emails could come from human senders, if that\'s the case give them also the bottom tier rating.\n
        Content Attractiveness (0-10): If I may find the content it contains tasks that I MUST DO and MIGHT HAVE NOT DONE, rate it above 8. If it is a one-off notification that may catch my interest, you could rate it at least 6. If it looks like a periodically (e.g. daily bulletins) sent message or email with nothing in particular, rate it below 4. If from the time being it looks like a task I\'m clearly ignoring (e.g. warnings that had been a while ago that I should have dealt with it), rate it below 2.
    </string>
    <string name="sort_end_prompt">The three scores should each be a float within 0 to 10 (inclusive), with 10 being the most highly rated. Try to produce diversing scores unless you really rate them equal.</string>
